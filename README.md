🚀 Built a Simple Text-Based Hangman Game in Python! 🐍

I recently developed a classic Hangman game using Python! Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time, but with a limited number of incorrect guesses. Here’s how I implemented it:

📝 Program Details:
Word Selection: The program chooses a random word from a predefined list of words, such as "python," "java," or "developer." This ensures each game offers a new challenge.

Displaying the Word: The word is initially hidden with underscores (_), and as the player guesses correct letters, they are revealed in the appropriate positions. For example, if the word is "python" and the player guesses "o", the display changes from _ _ _ _ _ _ to _ _ _ o _ _.

Guessing Logic:

Players can guess one letter at a time. If the letter is correct, it’s revealed in the word. If it’s wrong, the number of incorrect guesses left decreases.
I’ve limited the player to a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses, which adds to the challenge!
Game Over Conditions:

Win: If the player guesses all the letters correctly before exhausting their incorrect attempts, they win!
Loss: If the player uses up all their incorrect guesses, the game ends, and the hidden word is revealed.
